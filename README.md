# Healthcare-dataset-classification
This repo is created with the sole purpose of comparing the silhoutte values between two different kinds of unsupervised classification methods which are K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms.

The only files you only need is the .csv file containing the dataset of the used healthcare dataset to run your code.
I uploaded some of the results of the code to compare your version of the code.
